This folder is filled with experimental code that is not to be used in production in its current state. 

It is mainly for trying alternative methods of doing things to see if they are better, or short scripts that are mostly one-time use.

The code is kept here for completeness' sake, and to possibly use as a starting point for implementing alternative methods of doing ETL, such as using raw SQL or the Dask package in python (essentially pandas for dataframes too big to fit in memory).
