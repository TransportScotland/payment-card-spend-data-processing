# Things I can be doing:
* code to check whether the months actually add up to the quarters and sectors into districts
* think about how to fix things if the opposite ends up being the case
* turning stuff from pandas to sql
* converting to (batched) stream processing to accommodate huge data
* maybe think of a better way to create csvs and sql statements than turning into dataframe
