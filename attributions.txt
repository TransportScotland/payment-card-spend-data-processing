This repository contains data obtained from OpenRouteService (ORS), https://openrouteservice.org/, https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice. 
(There is no code from ORS in here). GraphHopper was also used to generate some distances, though these are not likely to be in this repository, either way https://www.graphhopper.com/.

The code uses data from Scotland's Census (https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/), England and Wales census (https://www.ons.gov.uk/census), 
and Northern Ireland census (https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/census).
It also uses data from Open Postcode Geo (https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo), licensed under the Open Government Licence. 
The data is not copied in this repository and it is used only internally.
